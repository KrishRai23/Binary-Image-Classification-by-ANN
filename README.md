# Binary-Image-Classification-by-ANN
Developed a robust binary image classification model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in Python to detect pavement raveling distress, effectively classifying images as Raveling or Non-Raveling based on visual patterns. Applied advanced preprocessing techniques, such as image augmentation and normalization.

# Binary-Image-Classification-by-ANN
Pavement raveling distress is a significant maintenance challenge in road infrastructure, and detecting it accurately is crucial for timely interventions. To address this, a binary image classification model was developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) in Python. The model aimed to classify pavement images as either "Raveling" or "Non-Raveling," a task that required careful preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure robust predictions. Leveraging a labeled dataset of pavement images, advanced preprocessing techniques were applied, including image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to enhance the diversity and quality of training data. This ensured the model was resilient to variations in lighting, texture, and perspective, key factors in real-world pavement inspection scenarios.

The ANN architecture was meticulously designed and optimized to achieve high classification accuracy. It consisted of multiple hidden layers with appropriate activation functions, dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and an output layer using the sigmoid activation function for binary classification. The model's parameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, were fine-tuned iteratively through cross-validation to balance training and validation performance. Additionally, the dataset's imbalance, common in real-world conditions, was mitigated using techniques like oversampling of the minority class and weighted loss functions. This approach ensured the modelâ€™s sensitivity to detecting raveling distress without compromising specificity.

The performance of the ANN model was evaluated using the Mean F1-Score, a metric that balances precision and recall, providing a comprehensive view of classification performance. The model was submitted to a Kaggle-hosted competition and achieved competitive results, demonstrating its robustness and practical applicability. Through iterative fine-tuning and analysis of misclassified samples, the model's performance was continuously improved, showcasing a deep understanding of feature engineering, supervised learning, and ANN optimization. This project highlighted the potential of AI-driven solutions in addressing real-world challenges in infrastructure management and reinforced the value of machine learning techniques in pavement distress detection.
